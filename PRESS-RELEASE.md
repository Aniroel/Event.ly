## Sub-Heading ##
  A product designed for people whose scheduled activites may be weather dependent and would like alerts if weather conditions will affect scheduled activities.


## Summary ##
  This application takes events that the user has set and compare them to forcasted weather for that time period.  If there is a weather change, the user will recieve a notification to potentially adjust the scheduled event.

## Problem ##
  This application addresses the problem of scheduled events/plans being hindered by unanticipated weather changes.

## Solution ##
  The application will take time, date, and general location data and compare this data against forcasted data for that area, looking for specific keyword flags ie. RAIN, HIGH WINDS, FROST, SNOW. It will then update the user of the changing conditions if it is within 10 days of the event.
